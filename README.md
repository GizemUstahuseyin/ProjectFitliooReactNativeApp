# üèÜ ProjectFitliooReactNativeApp
FITLIOO HEALTHY LIVING GUIDE - Everything about healthy living, a simple sports and diet application.

## üìã About
 -  This is a simple app
 -  Pure React Native, JavaScript used

# Firebase:
Firebase is a cloud service platform provided by Google. It offers a set of tools and services that allow developers to quickly build, test, and deploy their applications. Firebase includes features such as user authentication, database management, storage, server-side code execution, analytics, and messaging. All these features can be easily integrated and are user-friendly.

# React Native:
React Native is a framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications for both iOS and Android. It uses React, a JavaScript-based language, and doesn't require platform-specific coding. React Native allows you to write code that runs directly on mobile devices and enables fast application development.

# How to Connect Firebase:
To connect Firebase to your React Native project, you need to add the Firebase SDK to your project. First, create a Firebase account and create a project in the Firebase console. Once you have created the project in the Firebase console, you need to obtain the Firebase SDK configuration details from the project's details page. Next, add the Firebase libraries to your React Native project to install the Firebase SDK. This can typically be done using a package manager like npm or yarn.

After adding the Firebase SDK to your project, you can establish a connection to Firebase in your React Native code. Import the necessary Firebase modules for features such as user authentication, database management, storage, etc. For example, you can use the "firebase/auth" module for Firebase Authentication. Once imported, you can use the desired Firebase features in your code. For instance, you can use Firebase Authentication for user authentication and store data in Firebase Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore.

# Expo:
Expo is a development tool and service platform for React Native projects. It provides a range of tools and services required for React Native application development. With Expo, you don't need to set up platform-specific SDKs or configurations. Expo allows you to quickly preview, share, and distribute your application. Additionally, Expo provides APIs and components that can be used to add extra functionality to your application.

To use Expo, you first need to install the Expo CLI. Expo CLI allows you to create, manage, and run Expo projects. After installing the Expo CLI, you can create a new Expo project. In your Expo project, you can write the source code for your application and preview the project using Expo commands. Expo provides a mobile app called Expo Go, which allows you to preview your Expo project on both iOS and Android devices. You can install the Expo Go app on your device to preview your project.

In summary, Firebase is a cloud service platform that provides developers with a range of tools and services, while React Native is a JavaScript-based framework for mobile application development. To connect Firebase to your React Native project, you need to add the Firebase SDK and use the necessary modules. Expo, on the other hand, is a development tool and platform that simplifies React Native project development. You can use Expo CLI to create and manage Expo projects and leverage Expo's APIs and components to enhance your application.

# Regarding Fitlioo:
Fitlioo is a mobile application designed to promote a healthy lifestyle. It provides users with a convenient platform that combines fitness recipes and exercises. The homepage of Fitlioo consists of shortcuts to fitness recipes and exercises for quick access. In the recipes section, users can discover various healthy recipes and interact with a like button. Similarly, in the exercises section, users can view different exercises and save their preferred ones by liking them. All the liked content is stored based on the user's unique ID.

Just below the recipes section, there is a "Challenge" button that opens a timer for users to track their progress in quitting harmful habits. When recipes or exercises are liked, they are redirected to the "My Fits" page, where they are displayed based on the user's unique ID.

Under the exercises section, there is a "Todo" screen that helps users manage their daily plans. It allows users to view, update, delete, and add notes based on their unique ID. This feature enables users to organize their exercise routines, track their goals, or keep their motivation high.

The "User Profile" section in the settings page allows users to view their profile information. Placeholder data is displayed when users create a profile, and they can update their profiles based on their unique ID. The other settings section includes additional app features available for users.

The feedback form on the feedback page is fully integrated with Firebase, where user feedback is sent and associated with the user's unique ID to improve the user experience. Additionally, the "Rate Us" page asks users to rate the app, and in the case where the app is not available on the Play Store, it provides a Super Mario link instead.

Fitlioo is an app that promotes a healthy lifestyle by providing users with fitness recipes, exercises, and useful features. Each content and functionality is associated with the user's unique ID to offer a personalized experience. This allows users to effectively use the app, adapt to a healthy lifestyle more easily, and maintain their motivation to achieve their goals.
